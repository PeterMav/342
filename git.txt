1. 	Git is a versioning system that allows for multiple users to collaberate on a project. Git is different
	from other versioning systems is that SVN thinks of its data as a set of files that tracks their changes over time. Git takes snapshops of the data and creates a mini file system at the moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

2. 	A branch in Git allows you to work on a copy of the master branch without affecting the master copy. You
	would use branch if you needed to implement new features without changing the master copy.

3.	user@user: /GIT# mkdir test
	user@user: /GIT/test# git init
	user@user: /GIT/test# git commit -m 'my first commit'

	Or you can change to the directory that you want on git and just type git init

4. 	Use can add the files to ignore by adding them to the .gitignore file. Any file or extension type
	listed here will not be pushed to the repository.

5. 	git push hithub master
	You would do this when you have made changes. Can be done once you have completed or as you go along.
